# magicpi-socket
A python script designed to connect to a computer running a tweaked version of Magic-Sand using websockets. For a project in the course TFE4850


## How to operate
Create a .env file named .dev.env
This file needs two variables HOST and PORT, containing whatever host and port you are using. 

Added a basic server-client structure for testing before incorparting the socket structure in Magic-Sand
